Health Monitoring System

Project Overview
The Health Monitoring System is designed to analyze and visualize patient health data using machine learning models. It helps predict hemoglobin levels based on input features such as age, blood pressure (BP), sugar level, and cholesterol. The project also includes a Flask-based web application for data analysis and visualization.
